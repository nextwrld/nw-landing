## Context

In LATAM, thousands of small and medium gyms operate with a mix of paper, WhatsApp, and spreadsheets.

This creates a silent but expensive problem: **no real control**.

- Expired members entering anyway
- Lost or incorrectly recorded payments
- Duplicate or outdated information
- "Operations live in the owner's or receptionist's head"

The project's goal was clear: **digitize operations immediately**, without requiring hardware or complex processes.

---

## The Real Problem

The problem isn't "lack of software."

The problem is an informal operating system:

- The gym can't know in real-time who's active and who's not
- Access is decided by memory, messages, or spreadsheets
- Entry isn't recorded or auditable
- Technology adoption is blocked by initial friction ("I'm not loading everything again")
- The owner has no basic financial visibility: income, expirations, and real base status

The consequence: **direct loss of money and time**, and an operation that doesn't scale.

## Next Wrld's Approach

At Next Wrld, the approach was to design a product that installs as a habit, not as "software."

### Principle 1 — Adoption before complexity

The product had to work from day one, with minutes of onboarding.

### Principle 2 — Solve the most urgent pain

We didn't start with reservations, apps, or advanced dashboards.

We started with what sustains the business:

> Access control + updated member base.

### Principle 3 — Progressive evolution (sellable roadmap by phases)

The system was designed from the start to grow in stages, where **each phase is functional, sellable, and improves the gym's return**.

---

## The Solution: An "OS" for Gym Operations

**Gym Access OS** was born as a simple, fast, and progressive platform:

> "Your gym in order, without spreadsheets or expensive hardware.
> 
> Control access, payments, and members in minutes."

---

## MVP (Phase 0): Immediate Operational Control

The MVP was designed to completely replace manual control and spreadsheets.

### MVP Modules

**1) Member Management**

- Create / edit / delete
- Minimum fields: name, ID, contact, plan, dates, status
- Quick search by ID or name
- Status calculated dynamically (active / expired / suspended)

**2) Plans and Memberships**

- CRUD of plans (duration, price)
- Assignment when creating member
- Status by end date (no manual calculations)

**3) Manual Access Control (reception)**

- Check-in by ID
- Instant validation: active / expired / suspended / not found
- Complete attempt log (auditable record)
- Daily summary: entries, expirations, basic alerts

**4) Bulk CSV Import (anti-friction)**

- Downloadable template
- Pre-validation and review view before confirming
- Duplicate / format error detection
- Ability to update existing records
- Operation log (who, when, how many)
- Clear messages: "50 loaded, 3 with errors"

**5) Roles**

- Administrator: configuration + total management
- Reception: check-in + member list

**6) Configuration**

- Grace days
- Time zone
- Cooldown between accesses
- Global gym parameters

## Key Flows (what the gym does every day)

| Flow | What the user does | Real value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Individual registration | registers a member at reception | fast daily operation |
| Bulk upload | uploads CSV and digitalizes the base | onboarding in minutes |
| Check-in by ID | validates access in seconds | order + control |
| Daily audit | reviews entries and expirations | security and operational control |

---

## MVP Success Criteria

The MVP is considered successful if:

1. The gym digitalizes its base in **less than 10 minutes** with CSV
2. Reception does check-in without friction or errors
3. Excel/WhatsApp use is eliminated for validating access
4. An auditable history of access and expirations is automatically generated

The desired result isn't "having software," but **regaining control**.

---

## Product Evolution: From Control to Platform (roadmap)

Gym Access OS is designed as a system that grows in phases:

### Phase 1 — SaaS Core (multi-gym)

- Multi-tenant (multiple gyms)
- Central panel (global administration)
- Payments and methods (cash, transfer, etc.)
- Basic financial dashboard
- Monthly subscription per gym
- Backups and internal users

**Result:** SaaS model is consolidated with recurring revenue and scalable operation.

### Phase 2 — Operational Expansion

- Class and capacity reservations
- Attendance by zone/class
- Online payments
- Retention and usage reports
- Advanced RBAC (fine roles)
- Expense tracking and exportable reports

**Result:** the system goes from "controlling" to **managing the entire business**.

### Phase 3 — Member Experience

- Member portal/app
- Digital QR/PIN
- Expiration and promotion notifications
- Surveys and feedback

**Result:** more retention, more loyalty, less dependence on external apps.

### Phase 4 — Automation and Intelligence

- Churn risk alerts
- Price/promo recommendations
- KPIs and historical comparisons
- Accounting/marketing integrations
- Advanced automation

**Result:** from management system → **decision engine**.

### Phase 5 — Ecosystem and Regional Expansion

- Public API
- Multi-location / franchises
- Extension marketplace
- Partners / distributors
- White-label

**Result:** regional platform adaptable to different business sizes.

## Revenue Model (designed to scale)

- **Monthly SaaS per gym** (Starter / Pro / Plus)
- **On-demand license** (one-time payment + maintenance) for cases without connectivity or special requirements
- **Support and maintenance** included in SaaS; additional in licenses

---

## Strategic Value for Next Wrld

This project reflects the Next Wrld pattern:

- Start with the **operational pain** (access + members)
- Design "frictionless" onboarding as competitive advantage
- Scale through sellable phases, with clear return
- Build a system that evolves to platform (and then ecosystem)

Gym Access OS is an example of how to convert an informal operation into an ordered, measurable, and scalable digital system.

## CTA (soft, Next Wrld style)

If your business depends on spreadsheets and manual control, you don't need "more features."

You need an **operating system**.

**Let's talk about your operation.**
