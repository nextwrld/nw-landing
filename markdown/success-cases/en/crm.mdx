## Project Context

The real estate sector in Latin America shows a **fragmented adoption of technology**.

Most real estate agencies operate with manual processes, isolated tools, and a strong dependence on external portals for customer acquisition.

The challenge was not to build another generic CRM, but to **design a PropTech platform capable of unifying operations, automating critical tasks, and scaling with the business**, without increasing operational complexity.

This is how **InmoCRM** was born: an intelligent platform designed for agents and small real estate agencies that need efficiency, visibility, and control—without complex infrastructure.

## The Real Problem

Behind low operational efficiency, several structural issues were identified:

- Manual property publishing across multiple channels  
- Duplication of administrative tasks  
- Lack of centralized, real-time metrics  
- Generic CRMs not adapted to the real estate domain  
- Limited use of data for decision-making  
- Rigid architectures that are hard to evolve  
- Costly or nonexistent AI integrations  

The problem was not technological, but **systemic**:  
the business had grown without a platform prepared to support that growth.

---

## The Next Wrld Approach

At Next Wrld, we approached the project with a clear premise:

> **Automation only works when it is supported by a solid architecture.**

Our approach was based on three key principles.

### Think in domains, not features

Each part of the real estate business was modeled as an independent domain:  
users, properties, listings, metrics, and artificial intelligence.

### Modular architecture from day one

We designed a microservices- and event-based architecture, ready to scale horizontally and evolve without costly rewrites.

### AI as a decoupled component

Artificial intelligence needed to be an **interchangeable module**, not a patch or a rigid dependency.

---

## Solution Design

InmoCRM was designed as a **distributed platform**, composed of specialized services that collaborate with each other.

Key technical decisions:

- Decoupled, domain-oriented microservices (DDD)  
- Asynchronous communication through events  
- Separation between transactional data and search engines  
- In-memory caching for real-time metrics  
- AI applied to content generation and recommendations  
- Prepared for hybrid deployment (cloud / on-premise)  

The result was a technical foundation ready to grow without compromising stability or maintainability.

## System Architecture

  alt="Microservices architecture"

The platform is composed of:

- **API Gateway** as a single entry point  
- Independent domain microservices  
- Relational database for critical data  
- Specialized search engine for complex queries  
- In-memory cache for real-time metrics  
- Messaging bus to decouple processes  
- Container orchestration for scalability  

This design enables:

- Scaling only the services that need it  
- Avoiding bottlenecks  
- Introducing new modules without impacting existing ones  

---

## Artificial Intelligence Applied with Intent

One of the key differentiators was integrating AI **in an extensible and controlled way**.

- Automatic generation of property descriptions  
- Standardized context using Model Context Protocol (MCP)  
- Strategy Pattern to swap AI providers  
- Cost control through rate limiting  
- AI as an assistant, not a black box  

This allowed the integration of generative AI without locking the system to a single provider or compromising business-domain ownership.

---

## Implementation

The implementation prioritized:

- Strict separation of responsibilities  
- Event-driven communication  
- Safe and progressive refactoring  
- Observability and fault tolerance  
- Readiness for CI/CD and automated deployments  

Each component was designed to evolve independently, reducing long-term technical risk.

---

## Results Achieved

The system’s impact is reflected in:

- Significant reduction in manual tasks  
- Property publishing across multiple channels in minutes  
- Centralized, real-time metrics  
- Greater operational control for real estate agents  
- Architecture ready to scale without redesign  
- A solid foundation for incorporating new AI models  

Beyond metrics, the greatest achievement was **transforming a manual operation into an intelligent digital system**.

---

## Key Learnings

This project reinforced fundamental learnings we apply at Next Wrld:

- Architecture defines the future speed of the business  
- AI without structural design creates dependency, not value  
- Systems must be designed to evolve, not just to work  
- Real automation starts in the backend  

---

## Strategic Value for Next Wrld

InmoCRM demonstrates how at Next Wrld we:

- Design domain-oriented platforms  
- Integrate AI with engineering judgment  
- Build systems prepared to scale  
- Transform manual processes into intelligent digital systems  

We don’t build software on demand.  
**We design systems that evolve with the business.**
